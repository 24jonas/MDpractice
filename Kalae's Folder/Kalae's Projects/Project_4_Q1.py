1.)
To check your program, do the following very simple run. Let particle 1 be initially resting at (7.0, 6.0). Let
particle 2 collide into it with velocity (0.4,0.0) from the initial position (3.0, 6.0). Take DT=0.01. Run about 10,000
time step and graph the x-coordinate of both particle every 50 or 100 time-steps. (Can you animate this so that
you can see whatâ€™s going on? Represent each particle by plotting a circle of radius 0.5 ) Graph also the velocity of
both particles. Finally, plot out also the total energy, the kinetic energy, and the potential energy all in one graph.
Compared to the initial energy, how accurately is energy conserved? What kind of scattering is being simulated?
